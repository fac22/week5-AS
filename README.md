## Squid Game!

Inspired by the unbelievably successful Netflix series Squid Game (which a staggering 50% of us has even seen!) We've turned a children's game
into something mildly psychotic.

## GitHang! Hangman for Github!
Plug your github username into our patented Squid-i-fyer and prepare to get blown away by the intense experience of playing *actually already pretty creepy game*
hangman - but this time the person you're trying to save is *yourself!*

## Features: 
- State of the art React framework
- Use of an API
- Other things that we had to do to meet the pass requirements
- Easter eggs? You'll have to find out for yourself
- It's a metaphor for capitalism (I think?)

## Get started

Clone the repo

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

And most of all, *have fun*
